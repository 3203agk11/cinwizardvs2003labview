    LabviewCIN : "[!output PROJECT_NAME]" Project Overview
========================================================================

LabviewCIN has created this "[!output PROJECT_NAME]" project for you as a starting point.

Project settings have been adjusted so that you can easily create *.lsb files.
Two confguration have been created: "Debug" for faster comiplation, "Release" for faster
code. Note, that "Release" configuration by default comiple cod that can be run only on
pIV and above. This can be adjusted as usual through project properties.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that make up your project.

[!output PROJECT_NAME].vcproj
    This is the main project file for projects generated using an Labview CIN wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of the product that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

[!output PROJECT_NAME].cpp
    This is the main file in your project. It has been created using [!output SOURCE_FILE] as a template.

[!output PROJECT_NAME].h
    This is the project main header file. It defines couple routines used for debugging. We encourage
    you to use MyDbgPrintf instead of DbgPrintf when you need to print something out only at debug time

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    Usual win32 precompiled header stuff
