This is a CIN (code interface node) creation wizard for Microsoft Visual Studio VS.2003 which parses CIN code file created by Labview and creates a compilable project.

**8-14-08**   I uploaded the actual published version of my article. The problem is that both (draft and published) were so heavily edited by Labview Technical Resource staff, so sometimes meaning is lost. Also, I was not able to intervene, because the LTR was closed shortly after v.13-1 (Was it the last volume published, I wonder?)

**8-20-08** Since CINs are not the most convenient stuff at the moment this wizard should be redone as dll wizard ...
